# Hangman
This was a fun little hangman game I wrote in Python and used some ASCII art for flair.
There is a list of words and a word is selected at random. Then the user can 
begin to guess letters and the program will keep track of the letters entered whether
they are correct or not. Standard rules to hangman apply and there is no double jeopardy for
guess the same wrong letter multiple times.
